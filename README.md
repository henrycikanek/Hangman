# Hangman
Hangman game where the user is shown blanks representing letter of a word and then tries to guess and fill in the letters with a limited number of guesses.
I made this game in order to demonstrate the following skills:
   Manipulation of C-string variables (variables of type char*)
   Passing of C-strings to functions
   Utilization of the C-string library (#include <cstring>) to perform various
    string operations
   cin to read a C-string
